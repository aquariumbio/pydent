Trident Documentation
=====================

Trident is the Python scripting API for Aquarium, the software that runs the 
`UW BIOFAB <http://www.uwbiofab.org>`_.
The `code respository <https://github.com/klavinslab/trident>`_ is freely available to members of the
`Klavins lab <https://github.com/klavinslab/>`_ GitHub
organization, which consists of lab members and collaborators.
There is also a Javascript version of Trident available to that group.
